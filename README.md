# Code Editor

This project is a lightweight, web-based code editor built using **React.js** and **Vite**. It allows users to write and edit code in various programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, HTML) with syntax highlighting and theme customization. The editor includes a toolbar for basic actions like running and saving code. Users can also switch between light and dark themes for a personalized experience. The project leverages libraries like `monaco-editor` for the editor functionality and `localStorage` for saving code snippets locally. Itâ€™s a great starting point for building more advanced features like code execution, collaboration, or integration with a backend service.

## Customizing the Editor

### Adding Languages
The editor supports multiple languages out of the box. To add more, configure the `monaco-editor` settings in your `CodeEditor` component.

### Changing Themes
Use the `monaco-themes` library to add more themes or customize existing ones.

### Adding Features
- **Code Execution**: Integrate a library like `js-interpreter` for JavaScript or build a backend service for other languages.
- **Collaboration**: Use WebSockets or a service like Firebase for real-time collaboration.
